Ivy
===
Ivy is a data binding library for JavaScript which frees you from the drudgery of meticulously
managing application state and events.

Binding JavaScript Objects
--------------------------
Ivy is built around simple attributes that can be listened to, these can be wired up
to create state-full objects that are always up to date.

Binding to the DOM
------------------
JavaScript objects can also be tied to the DOM, allowing you to focus on the relationships
of your data.

Automatic Bindings
------------------
Manually binding JavaScript objects to DOM elements is fine for simple use cases, but grows
tedious.  Ivy provides straightforward, declarative bindings.

Attributions

This library was inspired in part by the work of [Steve Sanderson](https://github.com/SteveSanderson) (_no relation!_)
on [Knockout](https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout), and the [Shopify](https://github.com/Shopify) 
team's [Batman.js](https://github.com/Shopify/batman).  The event emitter code was cribbed from
[TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/visionmedia)'s projects.

Ivy is written by [Adam Sanderson](https://github.com/adamsanderson) with the full support of 
[Monkey and Crow](monkeyandcrow.com), two imaginary friends who let me play around with stuff.
